## Try this💡
### Here is my simple solution for sharing really small files. 

Share small files from an offline source using only a QR code!

## Why?

Imagine: You want to share a file with a friend nearby. You want to share from a source that does not have internet access - you just want to beam the file directly to your friend. This system lets you _embed_ your file into a QR code that loads as an actual file download on your friend's device. Try it out here if you're feeling brave! The image that is downloaded by scanning this QR code **is not hosted on any server, it only lives _inside_ the QR code**.

## How it works

1. **Generate a QR Code**
  - Embed a small file into a QR code.
  - use the [web app](https://amanraox.github.io/share-bits-wirelessly/) or the provided Python script.

2. **Share and Scan**
  - Show the generated QR code to the recipient.
  - They scan it using any standard QR code scanner capable of handling embedded data (e.g., a smartphone camera or QR reader app).
  - The file downloads directly to their device.

## Usage

### Option 1 : Web App
1. Visit the [web app](https://amanraox.github.io/share-bits-wirelessly/).
2. Upload a file and download the QR code.
3. Share the QR code with others.

### Option 2 : Python Script
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: 
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Generate a QR Code:
```bash
  python3 generate_pr.py input_file.txt
```
- The QR code is saved as `input_file.txt.png` (or provide an alternate output name as the second argument).

## Clarification: QR System

The process for generating a QR code is clear. However, for retrieving files, note the following:

1. Use any QR code scanner or a smartphone camera to scan the code.
2. Ensure the QR reader supports **embedded data decoding**, as the file resides entirely within the QR code.
3. Once scanned, the QR reader will automatically prompt the download of the embedded file.
